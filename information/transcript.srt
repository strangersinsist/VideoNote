1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:03,240
- I actually love this thing.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,520
I love this thing, not because
it's flawless or anything,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,239
it is far from flawless,

4
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:10,380
but because it's actually interesting.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,900
Like, don't forget the
last two, three years

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,769
of Apple Product review comments are just,

7
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,030
"That's boring, oh, it's just a spec bump,

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,440
there's nothing really new here,

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,790
oh, they hardly change anything

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,280
or try anything new these days."

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,190
But this, this thing is interesting.

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,100
It's risky, and most of all, it's new.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,740
Now, it's actually not fundamentally new,

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,440
it's a VR headset, but it's new for Apple.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,360
And there are a bunch of things in here

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,480
that are new in a way
that only Apple would try.

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,290
And just as interesting
as this individual product

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,220
is the possible future that this implies.

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,650
Like, when you get a first
generation product like this,

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,690
you sort of automatically assume

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,850
that there are goals for its future,

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,620
that it'll have another generation

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,970
and another one after that,

24
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,050
and that there is some goal

25
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,140
for what this will turn
into 10 years down the road

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,750
because we saw what
happened with the iPhone

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,610
and the Mac and the iPad

28
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,800
and all sorts of other
first generation products.

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,910
And on top of all of that, as
far as I know, Apple has never

30
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,670
released any other
first generation product

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,700
with the word Pro already in the name,

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,220
which comes with a whole
nother set of implications.

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,479
So is the world ready for all of this?

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,089
Let's get into it.

35
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:28,672
(upbeat music)

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,030
So I might be one of the
20 people outside of Apple

37
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,400
who has been using the Vision Pro

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
the most over the past two weeks.

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,470
Like, I've spent hours in
this thing with both bands,

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,770
with multiple Macs, in different
setups, different rooms,

41
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,100
indoors and outdoors,
lightness and darkness.

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,030
There are parts of this thing
that are absolutely amazing,

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,920
unparalleled, best I've ever seen.

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,530
But the reason it's so interesting

45
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,450
is because it's actually new

46
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,110
and there are downfalls
and flaws and trade-offs

47
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,180
that come alongside all of this stuff.

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,710
So at the end of the last video,

49
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,480
I gave you guys a sort of a preview

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,190
of my pros and cons list.

51
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,200
If you haven't already watched that video,

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,730
it is definitely worth watching,

53
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,200
almost like a prequel to this one.

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,950
It is a 30 minute monster all
about how to use this thing,

55
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,310
how it works, what's inside,
what it's capable of.

56
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,050
And then, at the end, I got to my upsides,

57
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,110
which are immersiveness,
placement and space,

58
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,000
eye tracking and hand control,

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,900
passthrough, ecosystem, and spatial audio.

60
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,990
And the downsides, which
are weight and comfort,

61
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,670
the eyes on the outside,

62
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,540
app selection right now,
battery life, and price.

63
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,830
So, okay, for starters,

64
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,280
I wanna amend immersiveness to fidelity,

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,630
I think that's more accurate here.

66
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,900
I have used a bunch of
different VR headsets now,

67
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,050
and this Vision Pro has the sharpest,

68
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,050
best looking micro-OLED
display out of all of them.

69
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,270
The size of individual
pixels on these displays

70
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,070
is seven and a half microns,

71
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,890
which means you could fit 64 of them

72
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,530
in the size of a single
iPhone screen's pixel.

73
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,970
You can't see individual pixels,

74
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,360
there's no screen door
effect, it's awesome.

75
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,250
The native refresh rate is 90 hertz

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,230
and it will crank up to 96 hertz

77
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,440
when there's 24 FPS content
playing to be an even multiple.

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,660
And Apple says that they calibrate

79
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,210
every single one of
these Vision Pro displays

80
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,934
from the factory for
maximum color accuracy.

81
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,290
They're really good,

82
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,070
and this is a big reason why
this headset is so expensive.

83
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,590
But then, and this is gonna
be a recurring theme here,

84
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,590
the Vision Pro runs up against
the technology of today

85
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,060
not being quite advanced enough

86
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,800
to accomplish what they were
probably hoping as ideal.

87
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,540
So in the case of these screens, right,

88
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,420
they're amazing, there are so many pixels,

89
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,920
but because there's so many pixels,

90
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,410
the computer inside cannot
actually render everything

91
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,810
in high resolution all
the time at 90 Hertz.

92
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,030
So instead, it does something clever.

93
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,120
It combines the insanely fast eye tracking

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,310
with what's called foveated rendering,

95
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,220
meaning, it's only actually
rendering in high resolution

96
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,820
exactly what you're looking
at when you're looking at it.

97
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,010
The rest is soft and fuzzy.

98
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,149
That actually works really well

99
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,860
because that's exactly how our eyes work.

100
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,720
It's really clever, like
you don't think about it,

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,420
but the thing that you're looking
at at the moment is sharp,

102
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,460
but then the rest of
your peripheral vision

103
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,440
is soft and fuzzy, and that's fine.

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,500
So really, now, all of the
computing work is being done

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,170
to track your eyes as fast as possible

106
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,910
so that there's no lag between

107
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,860
when you look at something
and when it becomes sharp.

108
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,660
Fun fact, you can actually see this

109
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,240
in screen recordings from the Vision Pro.

110
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,650
You can see the piece of the screen

111
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,060
that I'm looking at is sharp,

112
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,200
and then everything else around it,

113
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,580
even parts of the same
window are fuzzy on purpose.

114
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,380
But to my eye, that looks totally natural

115
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,540
because I'm focusing
on one thing at a time.

116
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,770
I found that you can also screen record

117
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,680
with developer mode in Xcode,
and that'll make the clips 4K

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,230
and it'll render everything
in HQ all at once.

119
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,910
But every time I did that,

120
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,630
it would be choppy and scrolling
would be slow and jittery.

121
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,830
And I'm thinking that's just because

122
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,680
the computers aren't really
used to rendering everything

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,820
in high quality all the time.

124
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,380
So it looks like a
higher quality recording,

125
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,660
but the second I did any
scrolling, it didn't look as good,

126
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,300
so I just didn't use
those recordings as often.

127
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,680
So the screens are great,

128
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,340
the position tracking of
objects and space are great,

129
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,930
the eye tracking is incredibly good.

130
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,030
The one ding against immersion
on the Vision Pro though,

131
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,500
and not a lot of people
are talking about this,

132
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,480
but it's the field of view.

133
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,610
See, the first few times
you use this headset,

134
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,680
you don't even really
think about it that much.

135
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,530
You're so distracted by
all the fun and the newness

136
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,470
and how cool it is that your
eyes are controlling the thing.

137
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,630
But eventually, you start
to poke around the edges

138
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,490
and it turns out, you
know how people are saying

139
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,040
it kind of looks like ski
goggles from the outside?

140
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,690
Well, it also kind of
looks like ski goggles

141
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,430
from the inside a little bit too.

142
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,910
Again, the middle is super
sharp and incredibly impressive,

143
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,160
but if I can do my best here
through a YouTube video,

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,580
the edges of the headset
are a little bit further in

145
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,020
than the edges of your vision.

146
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,900
And so, there's a little bit
of like a cone effect going on

147
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,850
and there's some chromatic
aberration around the outside.

148
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,010
So you kind of have this slight feeling

149
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,890
of looking into a large
tunnel at everything.

150
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,330
There are actually no
field of view numbers

151
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,070
published by Apple
anywhere about Vision Pro,

152
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,330
as far as I can tell,

153
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,620
and I kind of think that's on purpose

154
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,300
because I have noticed
from using them both

155
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,050
that the Quest 3 has a
better, wider field of view

156
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,400
just looking inside the headset.

157
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,590
So if I could change one
thing about the Vision Pro

158
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,330
to make it more immersive,

159
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,525
it would be a wider field
of view, no question.

160
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:39,108
(upbeat music)

161
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,070
Vision Pro has the best
passthrough of any headset

162
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,800
I've ever used, that much
is super clear to me,

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,940
and weirdly enough,

164
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,860
this doesn't actually surprise me either.

165
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,210
Maybe because this is one of the products

166
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,100
that makes it so obvious

167
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,570
that they're thinking
a lot about the future,

168
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,610
like Apple talks a lot about AR

169
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,100
and how they want things to just be clear

170
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,653
and just overlaying things
onto your real world.

171
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,450
But with today's technology,

172
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,640
again, that's not quite possible yet.

173
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,740
So instead they have a VR headset,

174
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,040
but they are using the highest
quality camera feeds possible

175
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,280
and the highest quality
displays on the inside possible

176
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,090
to let you almost feel like

177
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,190
you're looking through
it at the real world.

178
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,450
So you put this headset on,

179
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,210
and the first thing
you see is passthrough,

180
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,220
I mean, you might as well
call it transparency mode.

181
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,350
And the sharpness and the colors

182
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,930
and the very low latency are all so good

183
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,780
that I really don't
experience any eye fatigue,

184
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,110
no matter how long I am
in this passthrough mode,

185
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,510
despite my eyes being
inches from these screens,

186
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,550
I can interact with the
real world around me,

187
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,230
pick things up and look at them,

188
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,530
I can walk around, between
rooms and not trip on things.

189
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,510
I tried having people throw things at me

190
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,100
and I could just catch them.

191
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,470
I played table tennis
successfully with the headset on,

192
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,060
which is crazy if you think about

193
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,410
what's actually happening here.

194
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,460
The total latency Apple
says is 12 milliseconds,

195
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,610
that's from the outside light
hitting the outside sensors

196
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,267
to the inside image being updated
and hitting your eyeballs,

197
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,520
that's incredibly fast,

198
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,663
and that includes the
exposure time of the cameras.

199
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:14,445
That's the specially
designed R1 chip at work.

200
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:17,490
But, as Nilay from The Verge has put it,

201
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,910
it's still cameras and screens,

202
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,670
like the technology of today isn't magic.

203
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,100
So you still have to
expose a camera sensor

204
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,220
and set ISO and shutter speed, et cetera,

205
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,140
and you can kind of play
around with this a bit

206
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,498
just by looking around
like at bright objects

207
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:35,705
or high dynamic range environments.

208
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:36,990
And you know what,

209
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,539
for the variety of situations
I've thrown at this thing,

210
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,509
it's handled it very
impressively the whole time,

211
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,360
mostly prioritizing smoothness
and high shutter speeds

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,670
at the expense of cranking up the ISO

213
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,260
and getting way more noise,

214
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,880
especially in darker environments.

215
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,960
But you can still see stuff

216
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,330
like the hand occlusion breaks sometimes

217
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,830
or look really janky
when you put your hand

218
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,760
in front of something.

219
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,960
You can still see objects start
to float a little bit more

220
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,480
in X, Y, and Z space when
you're in much lower lighting,

221
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,580
as opposed to the usual perfect position.

222
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,384
Again, it's the best I've
ever seen with today's tech,

223
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:11,631
but it definitely still
has a long way to go.

224
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:15,030
(upbeat music)

225
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,810
So honestly, the
ecosystem is, I would say,

226
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,780
the strongest argument
for a regular person

227
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,893
going out and buying today's
version of the Vision Pro.

228
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:29,640
Like, every time a new big
product comes out or whatever,

229
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,937
I get like texts from people,

230
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,340
"Oh hey, Marques, you know,

231
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,770
I know you already made like
a 30 minute video about it

232
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,090
and like unboxed it and did all that,

233
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,810
but like what do you really
think about the Vision Pro?

234
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,837
Like, is it good enough?
Should I get one?"

235
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,710
And, truthfully, probably not.

236
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,200
But I will say that there
are a good amount of things

237
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,020
that I do specifically look
forward to using for it,

238
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,780
and most of those things
are ecosystem related.

239
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,030
So obviously there's the
built-in apps, right?

240
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,680
iMessage works perfectly,

241
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,320
just like any iPhone or
iPad on your account,

242
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,440
photos are all loaded up in
here straight from your iPhone.

243
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,850
This is clearly the headset

244
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,360
that is best for iPhone
users, Apple ecosystem people,

245
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,540
but also, little things
too, like continuity.

246
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,690
So I can copy some text
on my Mac or my iPhone

247
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,940
and then hit Paste and it
shows up in the Vision Pro.

248
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,150
But there's two really
impressive ones to me

249
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,150
for very different specific reasons,

250
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,240
FaceTime and Mac Virtual Display.

251
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,240
See, FaceTime is the most only
Apple could ship this thing

252
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,290
I've seen in a long time.

253
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,080
From the personas scanned
in from the cameras

254
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,140
on the front of the headset
to the positional tracking

255
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,540
and responsiveness of the spatial audio,

256
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,000
it's all so well thought
out that, you know,

257
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,320
once everyone on the call

258
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,840
gets past the initial
like, "Ah, what is this?"

259
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,180
The shock, the moment they first see

260
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,680
the virtual version of you,

261
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,050
once they first get past that,

262
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,660
then it actually kind
of slowly gets easier

263
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,870
and it feels way more
like a normal conversation

264
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,430
than a normal FaceTime.

265
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,380
And it trades the
downside of not being able

266
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,770
to hold up objects to
your camera for a button

267
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,830
that can switch to a real
time first person view

268
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,380
where you can use both
hands instead of one.

269
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,580
Does the audio from these speakers

270
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,020
still bleed out into the rest of the world

271
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,510
so anything over half
volume is incredibly audible

272
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,880
to everyone in the room around you?

273
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,630
Yeah, but does it also still
sound really, really impressive

274
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,780
for not actually being real headphones?

275
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,613
Yeah.

276
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:31,530
But the other thing is
Mac Virtual Display.

277
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,020
This is my number one favorite
feature of the Vision Pro,

278
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,745
even over like watching movies and stuff.

279
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:36,780
Now, first of all,

280
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,420
yes, you can already do
remote desktop viewing

281
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,440
on something like a Quest 3,
it's great, I love that too.

282
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,070
But this one is way more interesting.

283
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,890
So this is connecting to your Mac

284
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,050
and then intaking and re-rendering

285
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,630
a new virtual display for your Mac,

286
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,510
not mirroring what's already
being shown by your computer.

287
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,150
So you can use your Mac with
all of its existing controls

288
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,440
you're already using with it,

289
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,520
but make your new monitor
literally as big as you want.

290
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,060
And then, you can open up
simultaneous Vision Pro apps

291
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,100
all around that Mac display

292
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,320
and place them all around
the room wherever you want,

293
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,840
over the walls, floating in midair,

294
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,360
pin them to other objects,
whatever, you can go nuts.

295
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,530
Now, is this perfect?

296
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,570
No, there are definitely trade-offs.

297
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,160
From even the little things,

298
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,050
like not being able to see your keyboard

299
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,970
when you're in an immersive environment,

300
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,830
to only being able to have

301
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,650
a single virtual Mac monitor at a time,

302
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,650
to always having to look
where you're controlling,

303
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,850
I keep telling you guys,

304
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,580
there's definitely extra
brain cycles involved here.

305
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,620
But I do still think
that, despite all that,

306
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,250
this is my number one favorite
feature of this Vision Pro.

307
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,230
The number one thing
that you can buy it for

308
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,190
and do that you couldn't do
with any other Apple product.

309
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,023
I mean, it's the difference

310
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:53,190
between looking like this in a coffee shop

311
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,090
or looking like this in a coffee shop.

312
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,120
Pick your poison, I guess.

313
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,740
I also had a moment where I was using

314
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,690
the Vision Pro for a
while and I had my Mac

315
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,040
and some other monitors around me,

316
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,470
and then I took it off and
then I went and did something

317
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,830
and then I came back, and before
I put the headset back on,

318
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,150
I looked up at the wall

319
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,760
to where I thought a window was gonna be,

320
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,300
but I hadn't, I hadn't...

321
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:17,704
I don't know if that says
more about the headset

322
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:18,990
or about me.

323
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,320
(upbeat music)

324
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
But speaking of apps, we
gotta get into the weaknesses.

325
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,610
And the app situation

326
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,920
on Vision Pro right now is one of them.

327
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,960
So this is the home
screen of the Vision Pro,

328
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,300
it has all of your apps,
you can't rearrange them,

329
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,470
it's always alphabetical.

330
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,700
And this is a developing situation

331
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,590
that will record and improve over time,

332
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,160
but as of right now, as I
record this on launch day,

333
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,393
there are literally 600 apps
made for the Vision Pro.

334
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,030
And that sounds like a lot at first,

335
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,130
but then kind of not a lot.

336
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,080
There are also the millions of other apps

337
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,000
that are made for the iPad

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,510
that are compatible with the
Vision Pro that will show up.

339
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,020
But there's 600 apps made
specifically for the Vision Pro.

340
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,230
The few apps that are showing
up here are pretty incredible,

341
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,710
and they all kind of find
unique and creative ways

342
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,230
to take advantage of the 3D space.

343
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,960
And I fully believe the
rest of the developers

344
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,750
are also kind of still trying
to figure out what to do

345
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,120
with the 3D space in their own apps,

346
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,980
or even if it makes sense
to do anything at all

347
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,390
beyond the normal iPad app.

348
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,120
But at this point right now today,

349
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,870
I honestly believe that
there are way more cool ideas

350
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,400
about VR and AR experiences
than there are actual apps.

351
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,900
Now, don't get me wrong,
there are some cool apps,

352
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,030
and like I said, I've shown
some in the past video,

353
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,350
there are some more in this video

354
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,210
and there will be more
of them pop up every day.

355
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,880
But have you seen that video
of gamifying vacuum cleaning

356
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,410
so that you can actually

357
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,470
cover your entire floor space like a game?

358
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,320
It's not a real app, but if it was,

359
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,630
it would be pretty sick
and I would totally use it.

360
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,860
Or maybe you've seen that other video

361
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,030
of watching an F1 race in
Vision Pro, it is so sick,

362
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,000
it's like there's a virtual
track overlaid into your space

363
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,670
so you can keep track of
everything happening at once,

364
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,190
plus the times and, you
know, smaller video feeds

365
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,380
of the battles around
different points of the track.

366
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,120
This looks genuinely better than

367
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,000
the actual TV broadcast experience,

368
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,180
but it's also not a real app
yet, it's just a concept.

369
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,530
And I've seen all kinds of other stuff

370
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,530
and I wanna watch an NBA game court side

371
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,520
in the Vision Pro too,

372
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,190
but that experience doesn't
seem to exist yet either.

373
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,940
Whatever it is about like Apple
jumping into this new space

374
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,320
and all the implications of like,

375
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,620
oh, okay, the tech is gonna
start to get better now,

376
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,710
this sort of unlocked
this new creative layer

377
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,210
for people to dream of
new AR and VR experiences,

378
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,650
and it'll be up to developers

379
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,250
to actually make that
stuff happen over time,

380
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,380
with the constraints
of today's technology.

381
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,450
But as of right now, not a lot of apps,

382
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,630
also, no YouTube app, no Netflix app,

383
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,910
there's no Spotify app,
there's no TikTok app yet.

384
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,740
I hope that Apple can sort
of patch up the relationship

385
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,140
with these developers
because getting those apps

386
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,570
will make this a better product.

387
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,650
But as of right now,

388
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,603
that is definitely a weakness
of this first gen product.

389
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:10,186
(upbeat music)

390
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,020
All right, I'm not the only
one who's been saying this,

391
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,516
but this is not the
most comfortable headset

392
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,920
and I figured out why.

393
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,900
So first of all, everyone's
mentioned the weight,

394
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,230
and it's true, it does weigh like 25% more

395
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,670
than a lot of other headsets.

396
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,350
Like, take the Quest 3, for example,

397
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,660
probably the most popular
one, familiar to most people,

398
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,560
that's mostly plastic
and it weighs 515 grams.

399
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,180
So Vision Pro being made of
metal and having all this glass,

400
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,760
weighing in at nearly 650 grams,

401
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,720
it kind of seems like Apple

402
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,370
just didn't care about the weight.

403
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,320
But I don't think that's the case.

404
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,180
Matter of fact, if you've
seen the tear downs

405
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,890
or if you've seen what's inside

406
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,870
this little computer here on your face,

407
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,180
this is built incredibly efficiently.

408
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,760
There's carbon fiber in here, magnesium,

409
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,160
all sorts of other lightweight materials.

410
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,130
Now there's still lots
of obvious heft on it,

411
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,160
but 25% more weight
shouldn't be the difference

412
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,569
between comfortable and, like,
I need to do neck exercises.

413
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,103
No, the problem is this strap,

414
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:12,123
this is the Solo Knit strap,

415
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:14,280
this is the strap that's
in all the commercials

416
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,113
that everybody sees.

417
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:16,230
This is what's on Apple's website,

418
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,800
it's in all the Apple stores
because it looks so cool.

419
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,560
And I think when Apple was
probably first deciding,

420
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,780
okay, we are gonna get into
this VR headset market,

421
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,010
how do we differentiate ourselves?

422
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,349
We gotta reinvent a few things,

423
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,020
like the input method and all this stuff.

424
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,867
I think they thought the
strap had to be one of them,

425
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,610
and that's how we got this thing.

426
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,940
And I think Dave2D was spot
on in his recent video,

427
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,270
VR headsets just kind of all look dumb,

428
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,110
and the straps on them are all
so universally lame looking.

429
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,330
And this strap is just so much cooler,

430
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,120
you put it on, it's
the quickest to adjust,

431
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
it messes up your hair the least.

432
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,410
It obviously has this
little adjustment thing

433
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,540
on the outside so you
can scroll this wheel

434
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,377
and satisfyingly like tighten
the cables inside like this.

435
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,580
This must have taken a lot of R&D

436
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,100
to get this thing to look iconic

437
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,110
and actually be functional, this is sick.

438
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,300
But when you put it on,

439
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,940
you sort of tighten it up
against the front of your face

440
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,910
and it's squeezing it
up against your face,

441
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,010
all of the weight, up at the front

442
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,560
against basically these
two pressure points,

443
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,650
right above your eyes
and right on your cheeks.

444
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,430
And the more you tighten
it to prevent light leak,

445
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,500
the more uncomfortable it gets.

446
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,950
And it's just, it's so hard to wear this

447
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,010
for more than about 30, 45 minutes.

448
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,770
After 45 minutes, I really
do need to take this off.

449
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,180
So it's not your neck as much as

450
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,911
it's just all the pressure
on the front of your face.

451
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,400
And Apple knows this,

452
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,020
and that's why they've included
in the box this second band,

453
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,970
this is the dual loop band,

454
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,970
and it's super easy to pop this
one off and pop this one on.

455
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,970
Now it's not as cool
looking as a Solo Knit Band,

456
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,590
and it's going to mess up your hair

457
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,270
more than a Solo Knit Band,

458
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,270
and it's not as easy to
adjust as a Solo Knit Band.

459
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,950
You're literally like trying to find

460
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,040
and attach Velcro blindly
at the top of your head.

461
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,960
Basically, it's almost as lame looking

462
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,105
as every other VR headset strap.

463
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:15,660
But it turns out they all
look like this for a reason,

464
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,180
and oh my God, is it so much better

465
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,160
for wearing it for a long time.

466
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,570
I just recently did the last episode

467
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,620
of the "Waveform Podcast",

468
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,030
you can go subscribe over there.

469
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,430
I wore the headset for the entire thing,

470
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,050
a two hour recording,

471
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,990
and I could never have done
that with the Solo Knit Band,

472
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,880
and that's because it's
taking a ton of the pressure

473
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,400
off of the front of your
face and taking the weight

474
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,880
and using the top of your
head to support it instead.

475
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,870
It's so much better.

476
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,120
So if you're gonna just hand the headset

477
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,490
to someone to use it
for like five minutes,

478
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,780
the Solo Knit Band is great

479
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,580
'cause it's super quick,
doesn't mess up their hair,

480
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,500
easy to adjust, boom.

481
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,940
But if you plan on using this thing

482
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,910
for an extensive period of time, yeah,

483
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,996
the dual loop band is 100% the way to go.

484
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,320
(upbeat music)

485
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,110
So I don't know if the eyes
on the outside of this headset

486
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,000
are actually accomplishing

487
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,030
what Apple probably
wanted them to accomplish.

488
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,060
I think this, again, comes down
to what we expect Vision Pro

489
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:17,060
to be in the future, see through
glasses, way down the line.

490
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,680
But that's obviously not
possible with today's tech,

491
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,820
so the closest we can get
is a lenticular display

492
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,790
that shows your eyes to the outside world,

493
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,420
and so that you can see them
and they can kind of see you.

494
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,640
I don't know, at this
point, I've tried my eyes,

495
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,380
but also everyone else here at the studio

496
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,050
has also scanned themselves
in and tried EyeSight,

497
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,360
and it's just not very visible.

498
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,460
Like, the smooth glass of the headset

499
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,320
is so incredibly reflective

500
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
that there's almost always
some light bouncing off it

501
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
in a way that makes the eyes hard to see.

502
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,890
And even if you can see it,

503
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,180
it's pretty low resolution,

504
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,590
thanks to the lenticular display,

505
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,660
and the bottom line is it doesn't

506
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,990
actually feel like eye
contact most of the time,

507
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,980
which is very different from

508
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,690
what you might have seen in the ads,

509
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,340
especially for darker skin tones.

510
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,750
And I was actually
thinking about this like,

511
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,540
this is so far from
what I think I expected

512
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,380
that I was wondering,

513
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,590
does Apple in the next
generation Vision Pro

514
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,140
double down on EyeSight
or do they get rid of it?

515
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,030
And I think they have to keep it,

516
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,550
like it's such an iconic
part of the headset

517
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,530
that everyone's expecting it to stay,

518
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,580
so it's gotta be there.

519
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,580
But also, this is Vision
Pro and I think that implies

520
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,630
that we're gonna get Apple Vision

521
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,920
at some point down the road,

522
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,860
which is like a less
expensive version of this.

523
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,130
And with that, do you take out EyeSight

524
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,716
or does that still appear
in the lower end version?

525
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:41,160
I don't know, only time will tell.

526
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,827
(upbeat music)

527
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,160
So, all right, look,
at the end of the day,

528
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,570
when I'm answering those texts

529
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,860
about what do people wanna know

530
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,630
what I really think about Vision Pro,

531
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,070
I think the Vision Pro

532
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,070
is a really expensive, really fun toy.

533
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,710
Like, this is an incredibly
fun piece of tech to play with,

534
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,530
and I am loving watching
the pieces of media

535
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,780
built specifically for Vision Pro,

536
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,810
I am loving playing some
of the new early games

537
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,643
that are taking advantage

538
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:13,410
of the 3D space and the hand controls,

539
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,930
I am loving the idea of getting on a plane

540
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,060
and editing videos on my Mac

541
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,280
or watching a movie on a gigantic screen

542
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,430
while the person next to me
can't see any of what I'm doing.

543
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,320
That stuff is all so sick.

544
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,640
And if you're actually
thinking about buying one,

545
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,930
I think you should be able to expect

546
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,300
to enjoy all of that same stuff too.

547
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,140
But definitely still note
that all of the symptoms

548
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,000
of a first generation product

549
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,280
are definitely also still here.

550
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,070
It's heavy, it's not a lot of apps,

551
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,730
the battery life is
meh and it's expensive.

552
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,890
So here's the bigger question,

553
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,890
is the Vision Pro a guaranteed
success in the future?

554
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,320
Because the first generation iPhone

555
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,830
had all of the same
downfalls in its generation,

556
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,480
and look at where we are now.

557
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,040
So, also, same with the
watch, same with the iPad.

558
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,180
But here's the thing, you can't just say

559
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,760
the other stuff had problems
and it became successful,

560
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,710
therefore, this one having problems

561
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,880
also means it's successful.

562
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,713
It doesn't work that way,

563
00:23:12,713 --> 00:23:15,750
there has to be something about this

564
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,280
that people actually like

565
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,530
that makes 'em willing to overlook

566
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,245
the first generation downfalls.

567
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:26,007
And I think this has it, I think it has,

568
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:29,430
I honestly, it's kind of
just the sci-fi, fun nature

569
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,380
of like controlling
things with your hands,

570
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,910
moving windows around the room,

571
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,040
the sci-fi movie energy, you've seen it,

572
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,900
you're probably already
thinking of a certain movie

573
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,870
that has that sort of
energy, this has that.

574
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,790
And the fact that these ideas

575
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,410
of what people wanna do in VR

576
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,160
are so universally well liked and so cool,

577
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,050
that means that there's something here,

578
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,420
there's something that people want,

579
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,070
even in this first generation.

580
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,390
Now, will all this new attention

581
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,850
on VR headsets in general
shine a lot of light

582
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,400
on all of the other
much cheaper competitors

583
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,080
that you should probably
buy instead of this one,

584
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,234
like the $500 Quest 3?

585
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,680
Yeah.

586
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,230
Now, will all this new developer attention

587
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,410
in this VR/AR space bring
a lot of way cooler,

588
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,970
way more awesome applications

589
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,460
that will rapidly improve
the value proposition

590
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,373
of this $3,500 first gen headset?

591
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,190
Yeah.

592
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,890
Should you go out and buy one of these

593
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,210
if you've got the money

594
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,060
and you saw one or two
really cool looking apps

595
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,223
that you wanna try from the videos?

596
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,670
Sure, why not? It's your money.

597
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,333
But I'm already very excited
for the next generation.

598
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,410
Thanks for watching.

599
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,153
Catch you guys in the next one, peace.

600
00:24:42,994 --> 00:24:45,577
